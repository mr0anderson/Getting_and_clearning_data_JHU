run_analysis is a function that takes a dataset on body accelaration and gyroscpic measurements.
The files are seperated into a subject-file, indicating subjects for both 'train' and 'test' sets,
an activity file, that ranges from 1-6 based on activity, and an x_test file.

The x_test/train files list 561 columns with different feature calculations, listed in features.txt.

Run_analysis combines the train and test sets into one frame, termed 'learn'. It does so by
column-binding the subject and activities to the feature-vector. Also, it only selects the mean and std
variables from the features.txt file, by using the 'grep' function to extract the position and text-value
of these variables.

After combining both data sets, the frame is arranged and the average values per subject per activity
are calculated using the 'aggregate' function.
